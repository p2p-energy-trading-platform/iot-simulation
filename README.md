## IoT Simulation

The IoT simulator pretends to be the real world. It pretends to be houses with solar panels, and the smart meters attached to them. Its only job is this: **make up realistic energy numbers, and publish them over MQTT.**

### Project requirements

The following requirements need to be met before you set up the project

* Node.js **v24.5.0** or higher
* `npm` (latest version)

### How to Set Up

#### 1. Install Project Dependencies
Navigate into the simulator service directory and run the package installer:

```bash
npm install
```

#### 2. Configure Your Environment Profiles

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Open the freshly created `.env` file and verify that the `MQTT_HOST` and `MQTT_PORT` parameters match your active Docker configuration fields (defaults are set cleanly to localhost and 1883).

#### 3. Execute the Local Development Instance

To spin up the service in hot-reload development mode, run the following

```bash
npm run dev
```

#### 4. Run the Infrastructure Test Suites

To run tests:

```bash
npm run test
```

#### 5. To build and run the final executable

This is to test the production ready version of the app. It will compile to `dist` folder.

```bash
npm run build
npm run start
```
